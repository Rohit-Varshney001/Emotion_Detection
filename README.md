Face Expression Detection using CNN Face Expression Detection

This repository contains a deep learning project for face expression detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The project aims to accurately recognize and classify facial expressions into different emotion categories, such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, etc.

Table of Contents Introduction Dataset Installation Usage Model Architecture Training Evaluation Results Contributing License Introduction The ability to automatically detect facial expressions has numerous applications, including emotion analysis, human-computer interaction, and sentiment analysis. This project aims to develop a robust CNN-based model that can accurately recognize facial expressions from images or video frames.

Dataset To train and evaluate the face expression detection model, we used a publicly available dataset, such as the FER2013 dataset. The dataset consists of facial images categorized into different emotion classes.

Installation Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-expression-detection.git Change into the project directory: cd face-expression-detection Install the required dependencies. We recommend using a virtual environment:

For pip users
pip install -r requirements.txt

For conda users
conda install --file requirements.txt Usage Explain how to use the project here. Provide code examples or detailed instructions for running the trained model on new data or images.

Model Architecture Our face expression detection model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The architecture is designed to learn spatial features from facial images and make predictions based on them. The specific details of the model architecture can be found in the model.py file.

Training To train the face expression detection model, follow these steps:

Prepare the dataset: Download the dataset and organize it into appropriate train, validation, and test sets.

Configure training parameters: Adjust hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs in the config.py file.

Start training: Run the training script by executing the following command:

python train.py Monitor training progress: You can visualize the training progress and performance using TensorBoard or other visualization tools. Evaluation After training the model, you can evaluate its performance on the test set using the following command:

python evaluate.py This script will compute various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, to assess the model's performance.

Results Provide an overview of the results achieved by your trained model. Include details about accuracy, confusion matrix, and any other relevant evaluation metrics.
